<h2 class=summaryTitle>Summary</h2>
<div class=summary>
<p>Worked in Amazon for nearly 3 years in multiple fields, maintaining consistent metrics during my time, succeeding and learning as an integral part of my professional growth.<br><br>
Once I decided to move forward from this opportunity, I focused on continuing my studies in the field of programming at Cenfotec, as I look forward to developing my own ideas in video games, as a personal goal.<br><br>
Never have I rejected the opportunity to perform a task and complete the same. I have always believed that attitude and manners make the man, and based on my experience, every task can be successfully completed if the right mentality is set.</p>
